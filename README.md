# LogisticRegression Theory and Example
*Individual contribution to group project*

### Goal
The goal of the group project was to use Criteo's digital marketing dataset from Kaggle.com and perform the following:
  1. Formulate Research Question
  2. Algorithm Explanation
  3. EDA & Discussion of Challenges
  4. Alogrithm Implementaton
  5. Application of Course Concepts

### Solution
We had implemented Logistic Regression using Spark on the entire dataset.  This example covers the algorithm explanation section(2) and algorithm implementation section (4) in python.
